# Self-Directed Learning Reading List
What I've come to realize is that I am studying topic-to-topic, and by going about my work in this linear manner I feel 
there are great inefficencies in my approach. Instead of attempting to re-invent the wheel I am using this document to 
explore what is out there in terms of structuring self-studies to follow a learning model.

Please note, this is a working document, not a recommendation list. At somepoint I will likely summarize what I've learned 
and make a final version of the reading list.
